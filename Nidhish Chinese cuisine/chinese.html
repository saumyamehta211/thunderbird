      <p class="aboutpara">
        Chinese cuisine is an important part of Chinese culture and includes cuisines originating from  the 
        diverse regions of China as well as from Overseas Chinese who have settled in other parts of the 
        world. Because of the Chinese diaspora and historical power of the country, Chinese cuisine has 
        influenced many her cuisines in Asia, with modifications made to cater to local palates.
        Chinese food staples such as rice, soy sauce, noodles, tea, chili oil, and tofu, and 
        utensils such as chopsticks and the wok, can now be found worldwide.
        <br>
        The preferences for seasoning and cooking techniques of Chinese provinces depend on 
        differences in historical background and ethnic groups. Geographic features including 
        mountains, rivers, forests, and deserts also have a strong effect on the local available 
        ingredients, considering that the climate of China varies from tropical in the south to 
        subarctic in the northeast
